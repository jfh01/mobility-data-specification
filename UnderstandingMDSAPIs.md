# Understanding the different MDS APIs

The Mobility Data Specification offers three primary Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): `agency`, `provider`, and `policy`. 

Both the `agency` and `provider` APIs allow agencies to gather data about vehicles and trips from a Mobility Service Provider (MSP). Although the design of the APIs differ, they allow for similar types of data gathering. A city can adopt one or both of these APIs depending on their goals, tools, and resources.
